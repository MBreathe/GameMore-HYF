## Design

---

I'm going for a minimalistic design that I have been doing for some of my other projects. Inspiration for the
features came from the [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) website. Color palette inspiration:
[AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/) and [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/).
Design is done in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
